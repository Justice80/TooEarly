Title of Article: Isis murdered 80 Iraqis in a terror attack on Friday-but all anyone could talk about was Parsons Green
Editorial by Kristen Cunningham
The article I read was entitled “ISIS murdered 80 Iraqis in a terror attack on Friday-but all anyone could talk about was Parsons Green,” and it was written by an Iraqi living in London named Amrou Al-Kadhi.  He highlighted the discrepancies between what is considered newsworthy and not in Western civilization.  For example, Parsons Green had front page coverage for days, while on the same day 80 Iraqis were murdered by ISIS in Southern Iraq and there was almost no news coverage on it.  The author goes on to criticize capitalism, which glorifies the west’s way of life and gives the impression that it owns freedom while really the façade depends on savaging countries around the world.  In my personal opinion, I agree with many points of the author.  Everyday I see the inconsistencies between what is heavily reported and what isn’t. An attack on western soil that resulted in no casualties is more heavily mourned than an attack in the East that resulted in 80 lost lives.  This just enforces the mindless perception that western lives are more valuable that eastern lives. In this article, the author calls us to start trying to see “the invisible acts of extremism happening every day” (Al-Kahdi).  I consider a part of this extremism to be when massive terror attacks in the Middle East go unreported, since this supports the feeling that their lives aren’t as important or valuable as ours.  I also see this extremism when western governments ignore their culpability after selling weapons that land in the hands of terrorists.  These weapons allow more and more chaos in the Middle East, which only makes West look more like a utopia when in reality, they are fueling destruction and violence.  I found this article to be very eye-opening.  Being as privileged as I am means I can easily to let myself live in ignorance.  I can escape the horrors going on in other parts of the world because they do not directly affect my way of life in this western “utopia.”  However, that is something I do not want to do.  This article reminds me why it is so important that I actively stay involved in world events.  I must do this so I can keep updated on what’s going on the world, and so that I can get opinions from many different types of people, not only opinions that have been formed by people with similar backgrounds to my own.
