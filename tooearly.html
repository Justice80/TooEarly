			Title of Article: Isis murdered 80 Iraqis in a terror attack on Friday-but all anyone could talk about was Parsons Green
			Editorial by Kristen Cunningham

		<p> 
			The article I read was entitled “ISIS murdered 80 Iraqis in a terror attack on Friday-but all anyone could talk about was Parsons Green,” and it was written by an Iraqi living in London named Amrou Al-Kadhi.  He highlighted the discrepancies between what is considered newsworthy and not in Western civilization.  For example, Parsons Green had front page coverage for days, while on the same day 80 Iraqis were murdered by ISIS in Southern Iraq and there was almost no news coverage on it.  The author goes on to criticize capitalism, which glorifies the west’s way of life and gives the impression that it owns freedom while really the façade depends on savaging countries around the world.  In my personal opinion, I agree with many points of the author.  Everyday I see the inconsistencies between what is heavily reported and what isn’t. An attack on western soil that resulted in no casualties is more heavily mourned than an attack in the East that resulted in 80 lost lives.  This just enforces the mindless pe							rception that western lives are more valuable that eastern lives. In this article, the author calls us to start trying to see “the invisible acts of extremism happening every day” (Al-Kahdi).  I consider a part of this extremism to be when massive terror attacks in the Middle East go unreported, since this supports the feeling that their lives aren’t as important or valuable as ours.  I also see this extremism when western governments ignore their culpability after selling weapons that land in the hands of terrorists.  These weapons allow more and more chaos in the Middle East, which only makes West look more like a utopia when in reality, they are fueling destruction and violence.  I found this article to be very eye-opening.  Being as privileged as I am means I can easily to let myself live in ignorance.  I can escape the horrors going on in other parts of the world because they do not directly affect my way of life in this western “utopia.”  However, that is something I do not want to do.  This article 				reminds me why it is so important that I actively stay involved in world events.  I must do this so I can keep updated on what’s going on the world, and so that I can get opinions from many different types of people, not only opinions that have been formed by people with similar backgrounds to my own.

			This article covers a list of the top 10 museums to in the UK, most of these museums are in London with and the others in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast and York. With one museum being ranked one of the top 10 in the world. These museums show some of the best art and some deeper history of some of the UK’s most significant moments. 
			The tenth museum on this list is the Imperial War Museum in London which relays stories from those who lived the wars, from WWI to current affairs. Ninth on this list is the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow which houses a wide array of art, from classics to more modern pieces this stop has a wide variety of art pieces for anyone. The eighth stop on this list is the Titanic Belfast museum in Belfast, with a striking exterior this museum pays tribute to one of the most tragic events to ever happen by giving insight to the process from building the structure to its only trip. Entry number seven on this list is the National Railway Museum in York that shows the vast history of the UK’s railway system. The sixth spot is the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh shows some of the most popular artwork and the biggest scientific breakthroughs from the Scottish. Number five on this list is the Churchill War Rooms in London, where one of Churchill’s secret bunkers has been turned into a WWII museum. 				The fourth entry is from the Natural History Museum in London features some interesting parts of the natural, such as the skeleton of a giant blue whale named Hope. Third on the list is the British Museum in London featuring ancient history telling the stories of different empires through the times. Second on the list is the National Gallery in London host a lot of art pieces that attract a lot of people to the museum. The number one museum in the UK is the Victoria and Albert Museum in London where art and fashion are the main focus pieces in the museum. 
			Looking at this upcoming trip some of the venues on this list spike my interests, such as the Natural History Museum and the Churchill War Rooms. There is at least one location that I can think of that could have made this list since it had a major impact on WWII, and that would be Bletchley Park. Along with it being the home of the first computer, and the computer that broke the enigma machine code. Along with some more technological sites, but I think this would be a good list of sites to consider to visit.
